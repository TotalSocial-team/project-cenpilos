# Cenpilos
This is the open source of all the code for the Cenpilos Social networking site project

## Test Cases 
All the test cases are available under the `cenpilos/test` directory. 

### Notes on Test Cases 
In the testing suite `test_views.py`, the testing of 
liking, disliking and deleting comments are 
**purposefully** omitted since these tests are very similar 
to tests surrounding the deletion, like and dislike 
of posts. 

### Test Results
Every time we conduct a test, you will be able to see 
how many test cases the code passes and fails 
at any given time of the release of the code. 

Test results are typically located in this directory, 
in the text file `testresults.txt`.

***These test casees are NOT complete. More
test cases will be added once we add more features.***
